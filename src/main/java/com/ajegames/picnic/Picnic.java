/**
 * <p>This is the game Picnic.  The objective is to gather a sufficient level of certain picnic items in order to have a
 * successful picnic.  Players must gather at least 3 food items, 2 drink items and 2 utilities.  The first player
 * to do so is the winner.  Special items are throw into the mix.  One kind is a nuisance, which is something that
 * hinders the objective.  Another kind is a prevention, which neutralizes a nuisance.</p>
 *
 * <p>This set of rules lends itself to being completely computer driven.  That is, the game relies entirely on luck.
 * Other versions of the rules may be coded in the future that require additional levels of skill.</p>
